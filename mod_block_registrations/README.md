Introduction
============

On a server with public registration it is usually desirable to prevent
registration of certain "reserved" accounts, such as "admin".

This plugin allows you to reserve individual usernames, or those
matching certain patterns. It also allows you to ensure that usernames
conform to a certain pattern.

Configuration
=============

Enable the module as any other:

``` lua
modules_enabled = {
    "block_registrations";
}
```

You can then set some options to configure your desired policy:

  Option                               Default             Description
  ------------------------------------ ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  block_registrations_users            *See source code*   A list of reserved usernames
  block_registrations_matching         `{ }`               A list of [Lua patterns](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4.1) matching reserved usernames (slower than block_registrations_users)
  block_registrations_require          `nil`               A pattern that registered user accounts MUST match to be allowed
  block_registrations_confusable       `true`              Block usernames that look similar to the reserved usernames (requires Prosody be built with ICU)
  block_registrations_length_minimum   `1`                 Block usernames that are shorter than the given length
  block_registrations_length_maximum   `255`               Block usernames that are longer than the given length

Some examples:

``` lua
block_registrations_users = { "admin", "root", "xmpp" }
block_registrations_matching = {
    "master$" -- matches anything ending with master: postmaster, hostmaster, webmaster, etc.
}
block_registrations_require = "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$" -- Allow only simple ASCII characters in usernames
```

Compatibility
